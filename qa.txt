WARNING: ValueSet/toc-del-loinc-answered-by-LL5571-6-vs: ValueSet.compose.include[0]: This value set has a single include with multiple imported value sets. Per issue https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-25179, there has been confusion in the past whether these value sets are unioned or intersectioned. If this value set is contained in a package published prior to March 31 2022, it will be treated as a union, otherwise it will be treated as an intersection. If want a union, split the value set imports across multiple includes
INFORMATION: ValueSet.where(id = 'toc-del-loinc-answered-by-LL5571-6-vs'): The value set expansion is too large, and only a subset has been displayed
